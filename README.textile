h1. BlackList: dead simple content filtering

This library is just a simple implementation of a blacklist to filter content. It comes 
with a set of default words for filtering in config/black_list.yml that were obtained from 
"http://www.noswearing.com":http://www.noswearing.com. You can add or remove from the list 
as necessary. It supports two types of filters currently--exact matches and greedy matches. 
Exact matches will only match if the word is found on its own. Greedy matches will find 
words nested within other words.

Usage is as follows:

  BlackList.block?("Stupid ass simple.")    => true
  BlackList.block?("Squeaky clean.")        => false
  BlackList.block?("Assassins!")            => false

You can also just search for particular sorts of matches:

  BlackList.greedy?("Stupid ass simple.")   => false
  BlackList.exact?("Stupid ass simple.")    => true

It also supports highlighting flagged words:

  BlackList.highlight("Stupid ass simple.") => "<code><p>Stupid <strong>ass</strong> simple.</p></code>"
  BlackList.highlight("Squeaky clean.")     => "<code><p>Squeaky clean.</p></code>"
