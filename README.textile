h1. BlackList: dead simple content filtering

This library is just a simple implementation of a blacklist to filter content. You can add
or remove words from the list in config/black_list.yml. It supports two types of filters
currently. Exact matches and greedy matches. Exact matches will only match if the word is
found on its own. Greedy matches will find words nested within other words.

Usage is as follows:

  BlackList.block?("Stupid ass simple.")    => true
  BlackList.block?("Squeaky clean.")        => false
  BlackList.block?("Assassins!")            => false

You can also just search for particular sorts of matches:

  BlackList.greedy?("Stupid ass simple.")   => false
  BlackList.exact?("Stupid ass simple.")    => true

It also supports highlighting flagged words:

  BlackList.highlight("Stupid ass simple.") => "<p>Stupid <strong>ass</strong> simple.</p>"
  BlackList.highlight("Squeaky clean.")     => "<p>Squeaky clean.</p>"

A set of default words for filtering are included from http://www.noswearing.com.
